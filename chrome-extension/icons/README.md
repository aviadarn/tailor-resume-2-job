# Extension Icons

Place your extension icons here with the following sizes:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

You can create simple icons using any image editor or online tools like:
- Canva
- Figma
- GIMP
- Photoshop

Or use online favicon generators to create multiple sizes from a single image.

For now, you can use placeholder icons or create simple colored squares with the letter "R" to get started quickly.
